The reconfiguration is described with a single register of 32bits.
 Nibbles (groups of 4 bits) represent the valid configurations.

Requesting a reconfiguration: writing to the CR_CRR context control register on the core or globally (triggered outside the core), or using the sleep and wake-up system. TEN CYCLES are needed to make a reconfiguration.
