Instructions on the sim.do file.

The sim.do file is used to determine wich operations the simulation on modelsim are going to execute.

E.g we can tell him to execute a new '.do' file. In this particular case we're going to tell 'sim.do' to execute a new file 'wave.do', with operations set inside it.
